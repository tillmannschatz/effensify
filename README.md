## The Vision
effensify was born out of a simple yet powerful idea – to empower consultants, analysts, and professionals to maximize their productivity within Microsoft Office. With a name derived from the Latin word "efficere" (to produce or accomplish), effensify embodies the spirit of creating seamless, efficient workflows for those who rely on PowerPoint, Outlook, and Excel every day.

## The Problem We Solve
In the fast-paced world of management consulting and corporate environments, time is a scarce resource. PowerPoint decks need to be razor-sharp, Excel spreadsheets must be flawless, and Outlook calendars have to run like clockwork. Large consulting firms often have proprietary tools to enhance their MS Office suite, but for many independent consultants and firms, these tools are out of reach.

effensify steps in to bridge this gap by providing powerful, easy-to-use MS Office plugins that enhance efficiency without the overhead of complex proprietary systems.

## The Solution
effensify introduces a suite of products designed specifically for the consulting industry, helping professionals work faster and smarter:

- **[deckify](https://github.com/tillmannschatz/deckify/releases/latest)** – Crafting the Perfect Presentation: Presentations drive decisions, and crafting the perfect slide deck can take hours. deckify streamlines the creation and refinement of PowerPoint presentations, offering intuitive tools to align, format, and design with ease. Whether it’s fine-tuning a pitch or aligning a 100-slide strategy deck, deckify helps consultants work faster and more precisely.

- **[tablify](https://github.com/tillmannschatz/tablify/releases/latest)** – Data Management, Simplified: Excel is the backbone of data-driven decision-making, but managing complex spreadsheets can be daunting. tablify enhances table and spreadsheet management, providing shortcuts, automation, and formatting tools that enable consultants to focus on insights rather than manual adjustments. From complex data modeling to day-to-day budgeting, tablify accelerates spreadsheet tasks and enhances precision.

- **[calify](https://github.com/tillmannschatz/calify/releases/latest)** – Organize, Schedule, Deliver: Time is critical, and Outlook is often the center of every consultant’s workflow. calify optimizes mail and calendar management, streamlining scheduling, follow-ups, and signature management. By automating repetitive tasks and integrating smart scheduling features, calify ensures that no meeting or critical email falls through the cracks.

## The Origin Story
Our founder recognized the gap between large firms with proprietary tools and the broader market of consultants and professionals seeking productivity solutions. Inspired by the efficiency of in-house consulting add-ins, effensify was created to provide a commercial yet accessible suite of plugins that mirror the functionality of those exclusive tools.

effensify started as a side project, fueled by the desire to enhance productivity for individual consultants and small firms. Today, it stands as a growing ecosystem of products designed to optimize workflows, reduce friction, and empower professionals to deliver their best work.

## Our Mission
effensify’s mission is to democratize productivity tools for MS Office users, providing the consulting industry with the same level of efficiency-enhancing plugins previously reserved for large firms. We believe that better tools create better results, and effensify is committed to empowering every consultant with the ability to work smarter, not harder.

## The Future of effensify
effensify continues to expand, with new features and plugins on the horizon. As MS Office evolves, so will effensify, ensuring that our users always have the best tools at their fingertips. From refining presentations to managing data and streamlining communication, effensify is the trusted partner in professional productivity.
